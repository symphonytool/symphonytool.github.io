======================

This repository corresponds to the pages hosted here (at GitHub) for
the Symphony IDE.  The direct access address will be symphonytool.org,
but for the moment we're using the bare github.io address (DNS config
needs to be done).

So, [The Symphony IDE Website](http://symphonytool.github.io/).
